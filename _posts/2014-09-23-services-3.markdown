Group project was done together with my team-mates: [Firus](https://github.com/firusfaizal), [Hakim](https://github.com/hakimishere), [KT]() and [Leok Si](https://github.com/leokleok).

[Tradist](https://github.com/K2GFA/Tradist) is a financial visualization and tracking service which allows users to access historical financial data for a select set of key commodities, indices and equities. Users can sign up for accounts and via JWT authentication, gain access to our data set through an API. We also provide a visual interface on our app's front end, with a variety of charts available to investigate correlations.

Built using Node.js, Express, Plotly, MongoDB.
