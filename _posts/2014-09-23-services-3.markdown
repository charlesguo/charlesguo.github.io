( This was a group project done together with my four other team-mates [Firus](https://github.com/firusfaizal), [Hakim](https://github.com/hakimishere), [KT](https://github.com/khoodose) and [Leok Si](https://github.com/leokleok) ).

[Tradist](https://tradist-wdi2.herokuapp.com/home) (login as Name:Charles and Password:password to see the charts) is a financial visualization and tracking service which allows users to access historical financial data for a select set of key commodities, indices and equities. Users can sign up for accounts and via JWT authentication, gain access to the data set through an API. Tradist also provides a visual interface with a variety of charts available to investigate correlations.

It was built using Node.js, Express, Plotly, MongoDB.
